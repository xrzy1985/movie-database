### `Purpose`
Mobile App designed to be able to search a json file that is built from serializing a local hard drive of files

### `Note`
For personal use within my local network

### `Project Plans`
Webpack
Create DB to store data in once serialized  
Serve data via API or SDK  
    If API, spring boot  
    If SDK, TBD  
Remove all data manipulation out of the FE, and into a middle layer  
Adhere to a MVC pattern; pull logic out React Component file, and into a service file  
Test containerization with Docker and Kubernetes  

### `Todo`
