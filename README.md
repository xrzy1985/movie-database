### `Purpose`
Mobile App designed to be able to search a json file that is built from serializing a local hard drive of files

### `Note`
For personal use within my local network

Plan to incorporate a database to store the serialized data  
Create a back end service to serve the file via api or sdk  
Remove all data manipulation out of the FE, and into a middle layer
